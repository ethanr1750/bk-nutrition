#### Examining Nutritional Value of Burger King menu items

Introduction

Burger King is one of the most popular fast-food chains in the world, with a wide range of menu options that appeal to different tastes and preferences. However, many people are concerned about the nutritional value of fast food and how it can impact their health. In this Jupyter notebook, we will perform a comprehensive data analysis of the Burger King menu to explore the nutritional content of its menu items. We will look at various variables such as calories, sugars, protein, trans fat, sodium, dietary fiber, etc., to gain insights into the nutritional value of the menu items.

Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that the nutritional content of Burger King menu items varies significantly, and some menu items may have higher levels of calories, sugars, trans fat, and sodium than others. We expect that there will be a positive correlation between calories and sugar content, as well as between trans fat and sodium content. We also anticipate that some menu items may have higher levels of protein and dietary fiber, which are essential nutrients for a healthy diet. Through this analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights into the nutritional value of Burger King menu items and help consumers make informed choices about what they eat.
